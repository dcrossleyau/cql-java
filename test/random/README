In this directory, we test the integrity of the cql-java tools as
follows:

* Generate a random tree with CQLGenerate
* Take a copy
* Canonicalise it with CQLparser -c.
* Compare the before-and-after versions.

  Since the CQLGenerate output is in canonical form anyway, the
  before-and-after versions should be identical.  This process
  exercises the comprehensiveness and bullet-proofing of the parser,
  as well as the accuracy of the rendering.
