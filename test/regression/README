"queries.raw" is the file of test queries as provided by Rob.
"mktests" parses the raw file into sections and individual queries
"sections" is the top-level directory created by that program.
  "01", "02" etc. represent the sections within the raw file
    "01/name", "02/name", etc. contain the names of the sections.
    "01/01.cql", "01/02.cql" etc. are the CQL queries themselves.
"mkanswers" uses a trusted CQL compiler to generate corresponding XCQL.
    "01/01.xcql", "01/02.xcql" etc. are the compiled XCQL queries.
"runtests" compares the output of a CQL compiler with existing XCQL files.

"Makefile" controls the building of all this.  You'll need to edit it
if you want to use different compilers and suchlike from what's
written into it, so it may be easier to run the tests by hand -- but
it's a useful reference for the kinds of commands you might need,
anyway.

So, for example, if you think Rob Sanderson's parser, CQLParser.py, is
reliable, and you want to test my parser, cql-java's CQLParser class,
against its results, do this:

	rm -rf sections
	./mktests queries.raw
	./mkanswers CQLParser.py
	./runtests CQLParser sgmlnorm

(Except that sgmlnorm is useless -- gotta find something better.)

Also: there's a nasty hack here called "showtest" which, when run like
``./showtest 07/03'', will show you the ways in which my output
differs from Adam's.  I'll probably delete it soon.
