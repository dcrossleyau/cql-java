"raw" is the file of test queries as provided by Rob.
"mktests" parses the raw file into sections and individual queries
"sections" is the top-level directory created by that program.
  "01", "02" etc. represent the sections within the raw file
    "01/name", "02/name", etc. contain the names of the sections.
    "01/01.cql", "01/02.cql" etc. are the CQL queries themselves.
"mkanswers" uses a trusted CQL compiler to generate corresponding XCQL.
    "01/01.xcql", "01/02.xcql" etc. are the compiled XCQL queries.
"Makefile" controls the building of all this.
