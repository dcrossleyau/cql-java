The XSLT files in this directory are supposed to allow you to make
a thin-client for SRU using only an XSLT-enabled web browser.  It
looks like an HTML file is also required to get you started, though.

These were sent to the ZNG mailing list by
	Hedzer Westra <hedzer@NL.ADLIBSOFT.COM>
in a message entitled
	"Re: CQL implementation details"
on Monday 13th December 2004.  They are modified versions of files
that he says he got in the CQL-Java distributed he downloaded from
OCLC.  I know (as yet) of no such distribution.
